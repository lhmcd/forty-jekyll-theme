Iâ€™m a junior pursuing a B.A. in  Information Science at Cornell University. I have a diverse background and interest in several STEM fields. My experience includes roles ranging from aerospace data analysis to web design.

I'm enthusiastic, observant, and curious which means I'm always looking to learn something new. In my free time, you can find me reading a good book, writing, learning photography or relaxing on Libe Slope when it isn't freezing outside.
